Project Overview
The Sourcifi Recommendation System is a tile recommendation solution developed from November 2023 to December 2023. This system utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically the word2vec model and cosine similarity, to provide effective and personalized tile recommendations for users.

Key Features
NLP-Powered Recommendation: The recommendation system leverages the word2vec model and cosine similarity to enhance the accuracy and relevance of tile recommendations.

Utilization of Essential Packages: The implementation includes the use of various Python packages, such as pymongo, numpy, pandas, nltk, gensim, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow to facilitate data manipulation, machine learning, and web framework development.

Flask Framework: The recommendation system is implemented in Python3 using the Flask framework, providing a lightweight and scalable solution for serving recommendations.
